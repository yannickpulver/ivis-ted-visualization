Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged, Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her. Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to listen to her voices that she was able to survive."	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1800/transcript?language=en	2	2013	TED2013	0:14:17	8/8/13	"mental health,health,health care"1801	Julie Taymor	"Spider-Man, The Lion King and life on the creative edge"	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1801	"Showing spectacular clips from productions such as Frida, The Tempest and The Lion King, director Julie Taymor describes a life spent immersed in theater and the movies.

Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution -- one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit."	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2128/transcript?language=en	10	2014	TEDGlobal 2014	0:15:49	11/6/14	"architecture,infrastructure,cities,design"2129	Haas&Hahn	How painting can transform communities	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2129	"Artists Jeroen Koolhaas and Dre Urhahn create community art by painting entire neighborhoods, and involving those who live there -- from the favelas of Rio to the streets of North Philadelphia.Ã‚ What's made their projects succeed?Ã‚ In this funny and inspiring talk,Ã‚ the artists explain their art-first approach -- and the importance of a neighborhood barbecue."	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2129/transcript?language=en	10	2014	TEDGlobal 2014	0:11:23	11/7/14	"cities,art,community"2130	Ethan Nadelmann	Why we need to end the War on Drugs	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2130	"Is the War on Drugs doing more harm than good?

So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents."	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2384/transcript?language=en	10	2015	TEDxSMU	0:15:45	12/2/15	"family,economics,health,health care,TEDx,activism,social change,humanity,future,work,women,women in business,parenting,government,big problems,society"2385	Kristen Marhaver	How we're growing baby corals to rebuild reefs	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2385	"Kristen Marhaver studies corals, tiny creatures the size of a poppyseed that, over hundreds of slow years, create beautiful, life-sustaining ocean structures hundreds of miles long.

As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth."	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2423/transcript?language=en	12	2015	TEDGlobal>Geneva	0:14:04	2/8/16	"capitalism,money,finance,china,economics,United States,leadership,democracy,policy,global development,future,global issues,business,government,society"2424	AndrÃ©s Ruzo	The boiling river of the Amazon	http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2424	"When AndrÃ©s Ruzo was a young boy in Peru, his grandfather told him a story with an odd detail: There is a river, deep in the Amazon, which boils as if a fire burns below it.

## Getting started

In order to setup the visualization for yourself, clone the repository first.

```
cd ivis-ted-visualization
```

Afterwards, you need to run a http-server. I recommend using [Simple HTTP-Server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) and start it.

```
http-server
```

If navgate to the link, you should be able to see the visualisation.
